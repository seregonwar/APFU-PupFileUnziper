#description 
Pup-file-extractor is a simple and intuitive program developed with the aim of supporting the world of reverse engineering in the analysis of previously unpacked .pup firmware files update for ps4. This tool can help users to easily extract and analyze the data present in these files, providing useful information to understand their content.

# Credit
I utilized code written by SocraticBliss to implement several functions in my pup_unpacker.py file. Specifically, I used their code to extract information from PS4 PUP files, and I feel compelled to give credit where credit is due. If you're interested, you can find their original code in the ps4_dec_pup_info repository on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/SocraticBliss/ps4_dec_pup_info.

For anyone curious about how I incorporated their code into mine, feel free to check out my pup_unpacker.py file in my Pup-file-extractor repository on GitHub: https://github.com/seregonwar/Pup-file-extractor/blob/main/pup_unpacker.py.
